        <p>Dr. Norman Borlaug was born in 1914 on a farm near Cresco, Iowa. After completing his early education in his hometown, he went on to study forestry and plant pathology at the University of Minnesota, where he earned his bachelor's and master's degrees and completed his doctorate in 1942.<p>
        <p>Borlaug's wheat research started in 1944 with a Rockefeller Foundation-sponsored program in Mexico. That program was transferred to the newly formed CIMMYT (the Spanish acronym for the International Center for Maize and Wheat Improvement), which was focused on increasing food production through the breeding of wheat. In his work at CIMMYT as a plant pathologist and breeder, Borlaug developed wheat varieties that were resistant to “stem rust”—a severe fungal disease—and tolerant of many other important biotic and abiotic stresses. He also developed unique wheat varieties that could respond to improved management methods and to a wide variety of environments. He produced  least 40 important wheat varieties. </p>
        <p>Borlaug has commonly been called the father of the "Green Revolution" because of his tireless efforts, beginning in the early 1940s, to make Mexico self-sufficient in wheat production and his subsequent saving of millions of people in India, Pakistan, and elsewhere from starvation through high-yielding wheat varieties.</p>
